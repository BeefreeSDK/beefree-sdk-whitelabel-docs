# Page Builder

#### Overview

Originally designed as an email-centric tool, the builder has evolved in response to user feedback. Recognizing that many customers were also using the platform to create landing pages—often running into compatibility issues—the team developed a version of the builder optimized for web page design. This specialized Page builder is tailored to overcome the constraints typically faced when designing for email clients.

#### Email vs. Pages Content

The Page builder offers more freedom in design because it doesn't have to contend with the rendering limitations of email clients. Notable differences include:

* Form Content Block: The Page builder has a dedicated block for creating forms, offering a vital tool for lead generation or user input.
* Block Identifier: This toggle feature enables internal or anchor links within the content blocks, allowing for easy navigation across the page.
* Video and Custom HTML: The Page builder provides more options for embedding video content and does not validate or remove any custom HTML code, giving you more control over your design.

**Rows**

In addition to content differences, the Row options in the Page builder offer some extra features:

* Video Backgrounds: Unlike in email designs, you can use video backgrounds to create a more dynamic visual experience.
* More Columns: The Page builder allows for a greater number of columns per row compared to the email builder, providing more layout options.

**Settings**

The settings tab in the Page builder includes features optimized for web pages:

* Wider Content Area: Given that web pages are often displayed on larger screens, the Page builder allows for content area widths of up to 1440px.
* Favicon: This feature lets you upload a favicon (PNG, JPEG, or GIF formats), making it easier for users to identify your tab among others. You can upload or import the favicon through the file manager by clicking "Add favicon".\
