* Width
* Alignment
* Font Family
* Font Weight
* Font Size

You'll also find a dedicated field for customizing your form's submit button. This button is required and its text can be modified.

Fields can be set as either required or read-only, and the "Edit field modal" lets you change the type of form field you've chosen.

## Label Options

Labels are the text associated with each field in your form. The Label Options section allows you to:

* Format the text
* Set label position to 'Top' or 'Side'
* Modify label width (only available when 'Side' is chosen for label position)

## Field Options

This section lets you personalize the appearance of form fields by allowing you to:
