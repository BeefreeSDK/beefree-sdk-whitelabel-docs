# Saved Rows

### What Are Saved Rows?

Saved rows are pre-configured sections of design that you can store for future use in the builder. These rows could contain a variety of elements like text, images, or buttons, arranged in a specific way. They're a shortcut for adding complex structures you plan to reuse.\

Key Characteristics:

* Reusability: Once saved, these rows can be dragged and dropped into any new or existing design.
* Customization: Even after a row is saved, it can be modified without affecting its original version.
* Flexibility: Saved rows make it easy to maintain consistency across various projects while still offering room for project-specific tweaks.

### How to Manage Saved Rows

* Update: You can change the content or settings of a saved row at any time. This won't affect the places it's already been used.
* Edit Details: Change the name or category directly from the builder sidebar.
* Delete: Remove a saved row if it's no longer needed.

Using saved rows effectively can speed up your workflow, help maintain design consistency, and allow for greater creative flexibility.
