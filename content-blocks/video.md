## Video&#x20;

Adding video content to your designs can be an effective way to engage your audience. Both email and page builders offer distinct methods for incorporating videos into your layouts.

## Adding Video Content Blocks in Email Builder

While embedding actual video in emails can be problematic due to limitations with email clients and data usage on mobile devices, the Email builder provides a visually effective alternative. This method links to the video rather than embedding it, which sidesteps many of the issues associated with embedding videos in emails.

## **How to Use Video Content Blocks**

1. Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag the 'Video' tile from the Content panel into your email layout.
2. Enter URL: A prompt will ask you for a YouTube or Vimeo video URL. Upon entering a valid URL, a thumbnail of the video with an overlaid play icon will appear in the content block.
3. Icon Customization: You can tailor the play icon's type, color, and size to better suit your email's overall design.

## Using Video Content Blocks in Page Builder

In the Page Builder, you have several options for integrating video content:

* Self-hosted MP4 files via URL
* YouTube or Vimeo URLs
* File Manager uploads of user files (Note: CDN charges may apply)
* Free stock video libraries from Pixabay and Pexels (Note: Only for video backgrounds)

## **Types of Video Displays**

* Video Content Block: This is your go-to option for most video content. It's versatile and allows for a wide range of video sources and aspect ratios.
* Video Background: If you want to set a video as the background for a section of your page, this is the option you would use.

## **How to Use Video Content Blocks**

* Aspect Ratios: You can choose from a variety of aspect ratios depending on the video source and your design needs. Supported aspect ratios include standard formats like 4:3 and 16:9, as well as more specialized formats like 9:16 and 21:9.
* Thumbnail: For public or unlisted YouTube and Vimeo videos, a thumbnail is automatically pulled and displayed with a play button. This gives your viewers a preview of the video content.
* Privacy Settings: The Page builder supports videos that are either Public or Unlisted for YouTube and Vimeo.

## **Limitations**

* Externally hosted thumbnails must be served via HTTPS to ensure they remain visible.
* Editing an external thumbnail in the builder saves it locally, removing it from the external server.
