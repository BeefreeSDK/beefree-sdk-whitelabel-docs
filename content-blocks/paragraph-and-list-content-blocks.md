# Paragraph and List Content Blocks

## Overview

The Paragraph and List content blocks are specialized tools designed to meet distinct text formatting requirements. The Paragraph content block is optimized for long-form text, offering greater control over paragraph styles and spacing. The List content block provides an efficient way to create and manage ordered or unordered lists, complete with customizable styles and spacing options.

### **Setting Your Focus**

Take the following steps to set your focus:

1. **Locate the Row:** Navigate through the content stage using `ArrowUp` or `ArrowDown` to highlight the desired row. When a row or content block is highlighted, a high-contrast border visually indicates that the focus is active in accessibility mode.
2. **Activating the Content Block:** Once a row is highlighted, press `Enter` to select and activate the first content block within that row. This emphasizes the block with a high-contrast border, signaling readiness for interaction.
3. **Navigating Within the Row:** With the content block active, use `ArrowUp` and `ArrowDown` to move between the content blocks within the same row. This key sequence enables seamless focus and editing of different content types.

## **Editing and Customization**

Take the following steps to edit content and scroll through sidebar properties.

1. **Edit Content:** Press `Enter` within the focused content block to switch to editing mode. A rounded, inner border will appear within the content block, indicating that it is in accessibility mode. You can input or modify text in a Paragraph or manage items in a List. Utilize standard editing commands like `Backspace` for deletion and `Enter` for adding new lines or list items to manipulate content.
2. **Scroll Through Sidebar Properties:** Once a content block is selected and activated for editing, use `Tab` to navigate through all available sidebar properties in the forward direction. To navigate in reverse order, use `Shift + Tab`. This allows for comprehensive control over styling and formatting directly from the keyboard.

### **Exiting and Saving Changes**

Use the following key to exit and save changes.

* To exit editing mode and return to row navigation, press `Esc`. This key also helps to clear any active selections within the block, ensuring a smooth transition back to broader content management.

### Avoid Double Bolding on Windows

The **Title**, **Paragraph**, and **List** modules let you apply bold in two ways:

* Selecting **Bold** as the font weight in the sidebar
* Using the **Bold** button in the text toolbar on the stage

On **Windows**, combining both results in overly bold text. On **macOS**, it remains visually unchanged.

To ensure consistency across platforms, use only **one** method to apply bold formatting.
