# Letter and Paragraph Spacing

## Overview

Enhance the readability of your content with two key features: Letter Spacing and Paragraph Spacing. Available in the sidebar for text-based content blocks, these features give you better control over your text layout.

### Applicability:

* Letter Spacing: Applies to all text-based content blocks, including Paragraph, List, Button, Title, Icon, and Menu.
* Paragraph Spacing: Exclusively for the Paragraph block.

## How it Works

### **Letter Spacing**

* **Default:** Starts at 0px.
* **Control:** Use the - and + buttons in the sidebar to adjust. You can also type in a positive value manually. For negative values, use the - button.
* **Limits:** The range is -99 to +99 pixels. Rendering may differ across devices and browsers.

### **Paragraph Spacing**

* **Default:** Set at 16px, rendering paragraphs as double-spaced.
* **Control:** Similar to letter spacing, use the - and + buttons or manually enter a positive number or zero.
* **Limits:** Range is 0 to 99 pixels, and again, rendering may vary.

## **Use Cases**

While it's advised to use these features sparingly, here are some scenarios where they could be beneficial:

* Making all-caps text more readable.
* Emulating the text style of a logo or hero image in your content.
* Tailoring text for optimal display on various screen sizes.
