# Preview Designs

Use the Preview option to experience your design as your audience would. It lets you test and interact with different versions of your content before finalizing and sending it.

With Preview, you can:

* View your design in multiple languages
* Apply and test different conditions (for example, dynamic content blocks)
* Switch between AMP and HTML formats
* Toggle between light mode and dark mode
* See how your design looks on various device types (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* Use custom viewports to simulate specific screen sizes

This ensures your content is polished, accessible, and works perfectly for every recipient.
