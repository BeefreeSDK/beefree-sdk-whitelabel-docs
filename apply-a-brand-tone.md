Consider the following when using this feature:

* User permissions may vary.
* The more details you provide in the modal, the more precise the AI output will be.
* You can create multiple brand tones.
* If you would like to switch from one brand tone to another in the same design, ensure you refresh your design first so that the brand tone adequately transitions to the new one you set.
