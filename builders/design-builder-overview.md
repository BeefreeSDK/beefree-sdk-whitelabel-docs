#### User Tips

* An icon between the Stage and Sidebar lets you minimize the Sidebar, giving you more space to work.
* To begin your design, select an element from the Sidebar.
  * Design Components: Settings, Rows, and Content Blocks

#### Settings for Global Design Defaults

The Settings tab is your starting point for any design, allowing you to establish global design elements that both Rows and Content Blocks will inherit.&#x20;

Here, you can manage:

* Content area width and alignment
* Background and text colors
* Default font and link colors
* Optional settings like language and favicon (relevant for Pages)

These settings bring cohesion to your design, ensuring elements like font families are consistent throughout, unless overridden by custom settings in Rows or Content Blocks.

#### Rows: Your Structural Backbone

Rows serve as the foundational layout elements, defining the horizontal arrangement of sections within your design. \
