### Images

The image content block is a versatile component in the builder, equipped with a range of features for managing and enhancing your images.&#x20;

#### Adding an Image to Your Design

**Importing or Using Externally Hosted Images**

1. Drag and Drop: Place an image content block into your workspace from the sidebar.
2. Multiple Upload Options: Click the block to unveil a list of options for sourcing your image. You can drag and drop from your desktop, upload them using the file manager, or import them from social media accounts, cloud storage, etc.

**Note:** If you're working with dynamic images but leave the Dynamic URL field empty, the builder will default to a static image.

#### Image Settings and Features

**Accessing the Advanced Image Tools in the Builder**

* Image Tools: After selecting an image, an "Apply effects & more" button appears. Clicking this opens a tool suite for editing the image.

**Key Features**

* Stickers and Filters: Add stickers and filters to enhance your image.
* Cropping and Resizing: Modify the dimensions of your image as needed.

**Content Properties: Settings and Controls**

When you click on an image, the "Content Properties" panel provides several configuration options:

* Auto-width: This is activated if your image size is larger than the content block. You can toggle it OFF if you wish to manually resize the image.
* Alignment: Modify the image's horizontal positioning relative to text or other elements.
* Alternate Text: This text appears when the image is not displayed, crucial for compatibility in email designs.

#### Working with Dynamic Images

Dynamic images serve a unique purpose by allowing real-time updates to the visual content based on specific variables such as customer ID, dates, or other personalized information. \

Essentially, they can change when viewed by the end-user, offering highly personalized interaction without requiring individual design adjustments.

* Use-Cases: Examples of dynamic images include personalized greeting cards, countdown timers to events, dynamic advertisements, and product recommendations. The ability to generate these dynamically creates a more engaging and interactive experience for the end-user.
* Technical Overview: A Dynamic URL contains variables that the sending platform replaces when the recipient views the design. So, instead of a static URL like https://site.com/image.jpg, you'd have a URL with variables, such as https://site.com/image?customerID=\{{customer\_ID\}}.
* Configurations:
  * Dynamic Image Toggle: Accessible in the "Content Properties," toggle this ON or OFF based on your requirement.
  * Dynamic URL Input: This field allows you to insert the variables needed for dynamic content. The URL field can't be empty; it has to contain at least the static part of the URL to which variables are appended.
