# Mobile Optimization Options

#### Overview

The importance of mobile-friendly designs can't be overstated. While the builder's default settings aim for universal usability by automatically stacking columns on mobile devices, you may want to fine-tune this behavior. This section outlines the features designed to optimize the mobile responsiveness of your emails and landing pages.

#### Desktop vs. Mobile Preview

The default vertical stacking is widely supported. However, some email clients that lack CSS support will default to the desktop layout.

#### Special Considerations

Not every design benefits from the default mobile settings. Vertical stacking may distort navigation bars or other unique design elements. Therefore, always preview and test your design across different devices to ensure optimal user experience.

#### Best Practices

Although the builder offers options to override default behaviors, it's generally recommended to allow vertical stacking for a more mobile-friendly layout. Nevertheless, the final decision rests on your design requirements and creativity.
