# Hover Effect for Buttons

## **Overview**

The **Hover Effect for Buttons** allows you to add style changes—such as background color, font color, and border styles—that activate when a mouse moves over a button on desktop devices. You can preview these effects directly in the stage and preview screen. This feature helps you create eye-catching buttons and calls to action, like subscribe or sign-up buttons, that draw attention and enhance engagement in your email, popup, and page designs.
