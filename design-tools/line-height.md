# Line Height

## Overview

Line height measures the distance from one line’s text baseline to the next line’s text baseline. The following image shows an example of how Line height is measured.

### Compatible Content Block Types

In the builder, you can use the Line height option to control the space from one line's text baseline to the next line's text baseline. Keep in mind that Line height is only an option for the following content blocks:

* [Title](../content-blocks/titles.md)
* [Paragraph](../content-blocks/paragraph-and-list-content-blocks.md)
* [List](../content-blocks/paragraph-and-list-content-blocks.md)
* [Button](hover-effect-for-buttons.md)
* [Forms](../content-blocks/forms/)
* [Tables](../content-blocks/table.md)

### Relevant Design Scenarios

A few scenarios in which this might be helpful are:

* When your design requires a high-level of precision, which requires more granular-level controls.
* Adhering to strict brand guidelines.
* Increasing the accessibility of your designs.

## How to Use Line Height

Take the following step to edit or adjust the Line height within text-based content in your design:

1. Navigate to the builder.
2. Click on one of the qualifying block types on the stage.
3. Navigate to the **Content** tab within the sidebar.
4.  Scroll under the content block's properties, until you find the **Line height** drop-down option.&#x20;

5. Select of the available Line height options in the drop-down menu, or select **Custom** if you'd like to set your own.
6. If you select Custom, use the minus (**-**) and plus (**+**) signs to adjust the Line height accordingly.&#x20;

## Additional Consideration

Consider the following when using Line height:

* The minimum value is 0.5.
* The maximum value is 3.
* When you select the **Custom** option from the Line height drop-down menu, you can click plus (+) or minus (-) to increase or decrease the Line height value. The Line height value will increase or decrease in increments of 0.1.
* If you manually type in a value with two numbers after the decimal, for example 0.57, the Line height will be rounded to the first number as the final value. So, the final value would be 0.6.&#x20;
