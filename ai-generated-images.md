* Stability AI AddOn Activated and available in the builder

## How to use

Take the following steps to use AI to generate images and add them to your designs within the builder.

1. Enter your design.
2. Navigate to the section of your design you'd like to an an AI-generated image to.
3. Drag and drop the **Image** content block on to the canvas where you'd like your image to appear.
4.  Click on the **Image** content block on the canvas.

    You will notice the **Content Properties** appear inside the panel located on the right-hand side of the screen.
5. Click the **Create with AI** button.
6. Complete the following required information:
   1. **Prompt:** A description of what you'd like the image to be of.
   2. **Negative prompt:** A description of what you do not want included in the image.
   3. **Aspect ratio:** You can select 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, or 16:9.&#x20;
   4. **Style:** The type of style you'd like to apply to your image.
   5. **Advanced Options** (Optional): You can set the CGF tolerance and the Steps.\*
7. Click **Generate image**

The AI-generated image will appear after a few seconds. You can decide to apply the image, to regenerate it, or you can edit the prompts and settings to generate a new image.

\*Reference the following definitions to understand the impact of setting CFG tolerance and steps when submitting your prompt to create an image.

* **CFG Tolerance:** Controls how closely the AI should adhere to the prompt. Higher values lead to more accurate interpretations, while lower values allow for more creative freedom.
* **Steps:** The number of processing iterations the AI will perform. More steps typically result in higher-quality and more detailed images, but take longer to generate.

The following video provides a visual example on how to use the **Create with AI** image option.
