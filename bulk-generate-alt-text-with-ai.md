## Overview <a href="#h_01hnegbp4dgezr04v1hf2g3ezw" id="h_01hnegbp4dgezr04v1hf2g3ezw"></a>

Al Alt text Bulk Generation is an extension of Alt text Generation with AI. Weâ€™ve extended the functionality to enable you to generate alt text for all the image modules within your design at once. We created this new functionality to save you even more time as you make your designs more accessible. Now, instead of using AI to generate the alt text for each image module within your design one by one, you can generate alt text for all of them at once.

### Token Limitations <a href="#h_01hnjnfww732g9b0zcyrmfcqbh" id="h_01hnjnfww732g9b0zcyrmfcqbh"></a>

While using this feature, you may experience image token limitations. Each image type you generate alt text for using this feature requires image tokens. If you do not have enough image tokens in your account, you will not be able to generate alt text for the images. The application will; however, inform you about your available image tokens and redirect you to purchase more if you do not have sufficient to complete your current task.
