#### Functionality

* Toggle between light and dark mode to assess design impact.
* If using display conditions, preview their effect as well.

#### Limitations

Note that the preview approximates based on popular devices and platforms. This is especially relevant for email designs and dark mode, as different devices and email clients may render your design differently.
