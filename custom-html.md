# Custom HTML

#### Overview

The Custom HTML content block enables you to insert your own HTML code into designs crafted in the builder. While it's as straightforward as adding a text block, this feature is primarily intended for those proficient in HTML. Using custom HTML can impact how your design adjusts to various screen sizes, so make sure the HTML you use is responsive and email compliant. Note that custom HTML typically falls outside of standard support.\

#### Why Use Custom HTML?

Here are a few scenarios where custom HTML can be valuable:

* Customized Content: You're not restricted to predefined settings, giving you more control over styling.
* Special Elements: Add content like HTML5 videos or anchor links, which are not standard elements in the builder.
* Advanced CSS Effects: While CSS animations aren't universally supported in emails, they can make your web pages more engaging.
* Live Content: Embed real-time content like product recommendations or countdowns by pasting code from external vendors.

#### How to Add Custom HTML

1. Drag the Block: Insert an HTML content block into your design, just like you would with any other block.
2. Edit HTML: Click the block to open the HTML editor on the sidebar. You'll see placeholder code, which you can replace with your own HTML. Syntax highlighting and indentation features help make the code readable.

#### HTML Tag Restrictions in Emails

When adding custom HTML to emails, a code sanitizer checks and automatically corrects your code. Unsupported tags like \<script> and \<iframe> are removed to avoid security risks and deliverability issues.

Allowed HTML Tags: (for emails only)

* Tags: a, abbr, address, area, b, bdo, etc.
* Attributes: style, id, class, data-\*, title, href, name, target, etc.

#### Using Custom HTML with Pages

The Page Builder doesn't employ a sanitizer, offering more freedom but also more responsibility. You can use any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript syntax when designing landing pages.
