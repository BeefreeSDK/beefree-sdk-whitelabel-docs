## Overview <a href="#h_01hneg4ej9t620swcqpg70a3z0" id="h_01hneg4ej9t620swcqpg70a3z0"></a>

Leveraging artificial intelligence as a productivity tool is becoming increasingly popular. At Beefree, we are developing new features using AI to help make your design experience smoother and more efficient.

The AI-generated Preheaders, Titles, Subject Lines, and Meta Descriptions feature enables you to leverage AI capabilities to increase your productivity within the page and email builders. This feature will pull context from your design to create a relevant preheader, title, subject line, or meta description for you.

In this article you will learn more about how to use this feature within the builder.

1. Enter the page builder
2. Navigate to **Settings**
3. Scroll to **OPTIONAL PROPERTIES**
   1.  Click the wand icon on the right-hand side

       A drop-down menu will appear with three different options
4.  Select the option you would like to generate

    A window will appear
5. Select a **Tone of voice** from the dropdown menu
6.  Review the generated responses

    Confirm the responses meet your content requirements
7. Click **APPLY ALL**

You will have the following options to select from in the drop-down mentioned in step three:

* Generate all details

**Note:** You will have the option to regenerate responses with AI if you do not like what is initially generated. Regenerating responses will use additional tokens.

### Token Limitations <a href="#h_01hnjn73y20ymr45yzc4d7bv1r" id="h_01hnjn73y20ymr45yzc4d7bv1r"></a>

While using this feature, you may experience token limitations. Each Title, Subject, Preheader, and Description you generate using this feature requires tokens to generate the text using AI. If you do not have enough tokens in your account, you will not be able to generate these fields. The application will; however, inform you about your available tokens and redirect you to purchase more if you do not have sufficient to complete your current task. &#x20;
