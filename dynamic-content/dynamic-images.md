# Dynamic Images

### Working with Dynamic Images

Dynamic images serve a unique purpose by allowing real-time updates to the visual content based on specific variables such as customer ID, dates, or other personalized information. \

Essentially, they can change when viewed by the content recipient or viewer, offering highly personalized interaction without requiring individual design adjustments.

* **Use-Cases:** Examples of dynamic images include personalized greeting cards, countdown timers to events, dynamic advertisements, and product recommendations. The ability to generate these dynamically creates a more engaging and interactive experience for the viewer or recipient.
* **Technical Overview:** A Dynamic URL contains variables that the sending platform replaces when the recipient views the design. So, instead of a static URL like https://site.com/image.jpg, you'd have a URL with variables, such as https://site.com/image?customerID=\{{customer\_ID\}}.
* **Configurations:**
  * **Dynamic Image Toggle:** Accessible in the "Content Properties," toggle this ON or OFF based on your requirement.
  * **Dynamic URL Input:** This field allows you to insert the variables needed for dynamic content. The URL field can't be empty; it has to contain at least the static part of the URL to which variables are appended.
