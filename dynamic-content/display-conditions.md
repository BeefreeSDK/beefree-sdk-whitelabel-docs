# Display Conditions

### Overview

Display conditions provide the capability for conditional content rendering in your emails. This allows for highly targeted messaging based on specific conditions such as whether a recipient is a current user of a product. It's worth noting that the builder itself does not interpret these conditions; that's the job of your sending platform.

### Setting Up Display Conditions

* Accessing the Feature: Once enabled, 'Display Conditions' will be visible under the 'Row Properties' in the builder sidebar.
* Creating a Condition: Click on 'Add condition' to trigger a modal overlay on your builder screen.
* Naming & Describing: Use these fields for a brief explanation and name for the condition, assisting you in later previews.

### Syntax and Editing

* Entering Syntax: Populate the 'Before' and 'After' fields with your conditional syntax.
* Saving & Modifying: Click 'Confirm' to save your condition. It will appear in the sidebar, where you can also edit it if necessary.
* Removal: An icon is provided if you wish to delete the condition.

### Previewing and Testing Conditions

* Preview Mode: Navigate to 'Actions' and select 'Preview'.
* Toggling Conditions: Within the preview, use the dropdown menu 'Select row conditions' to turn conditions on or off to see how they affect the email layout.

### Important Notes

* Retaining Conditions: Although the builder won't save your display conditions as standalone settings, they are retained within specific emails or templates. They can be carried over through copying or generating new templates/emails.
* Dynamic Content: Conditions also allow for dynamic content within the rows, such as text or images. You can employ merge tags or dynamic images based on the condition.
* Syntax and Validation: The builder does not validate the syntax used for conditions; it's interpreted by your sending platform.

Understanding and utilizing display conditions correctly can significantly elevate the customization and effectiveness of your email campaigns.
